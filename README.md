# TransformMe
Currently, there are no applications for travellers where they can see best places to visit depending upon type of place, edit pictures they have taken in that place and also share those pictures with other users. Our application is mainly intended for avid and enthusiastic travellers who would like to visit places of historical importance, scenic beauty and wildlife. A traveller can use this mobile android app to select a type of place he wants to visit such as amusement park, art gallery, aquarium, zoo, park &amp; museum and radius (in meters) within which he wants to travel depending on the mode of transport. The top 5 best rated places of selected type will be shown on the Map with his current location too, as circles. The Map has been made very interactive where the user can see the number of TransformMe users who have visited in those five places. Also, each of the 5 markers can be clicked to open a gallery which shows the street view if available along with the top 5 recent images of that place uploaded by application users. In addition, the user can view his own gallery where one can see all the images uploaded by him/her till date using this app. There is no single application which gives a combination of all these which could be very interesting, helpful and interactive for a traveller.
